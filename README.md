## Project Overview

This web app is created using Astro.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. It's designed to help users improve their typing skills. There are a few issues that need your attention.

## Tasks

### 1. Track Correct and Wrong Inputs

The current version of the app lacks the ability to track correct and wrong inputs while users are typing. Your task is to implement functionality that accurately records these inputs and displays the results once a user completes the typing test.

### 2. Finish the Amharic Component

The Amharic component in the app is not functioning correctly, and the keyboard layout does not adhere to the specified rules ([Lexilogos Amharic Keyboard](https://lexilogos.com/keyboard/amharic.htm)). Your goal is to fix the Amharic component, ensuring that it works as intended and follows the prescribed keyboard layout rules.

### 3. Refactor React Components

The app currently has two separate components, `PoemEn` and `PoemAn`. Your task is to refactor these components and create a new, more generic `Poem` component that accepts the language as a parameter. This refactor should enhance code maintainability and reusability.
